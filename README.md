# England and Wales Housing Affordability Analysis (1997-2024)
Analysing the inflation-adjusted relationship between property prices and salaries across England and Wales between 1997 and 2024.
## Background
The UK housing market has undergone significant change since 1997, with property prices rising substantially faster than wages. This project aims to quantify the extent of this divergence by analysing the relationship between property prices and workplace=based earnings at the local authority and regional level, over a period of 27 years.
## Aims
This analysis addresses four, key questions:
- To what extent have property prices outpaced salary growth?
- How have major economic events, e.g., the 2008 financial crisis, the Brexit referendum, COVID-19 pandemic, etc., affected housing affordability?
- Which local authorities and regions show the greatest disparities between prices and earnings?
- What impact have new property developments had on affordability?
